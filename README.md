# airbnb-big-data-analytics-uc3m

This academic project was developed as part of the course Big Data & Business Analytics in the Bachelor’s Degree in Management and Technology at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M).
The objective was to analyze a large-scale Airbnb dataset (300k+ listings) to extract business, pricing, geographic and customer satisfaction insights, supporting data-driven investment and operational decisions.

## Goals
- Identify key drivers of price, occupancy and guest satisfaction.
- Compare Madrid vs Barcelona from an investment and operational perspective.
- Detect optimal property configurations and locations.
- Analyze guest reviews using NLP techniques to uncover latent themes and biases.

## Methodology & Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on pricing, occupancy, property type and amenities.
- Geographic analysis to identify premium and emerging investment areas.
- Regression models (Ridge Regression) to estimate satisfaction and value drivers.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP):
1. Sentiment analysis using BERT.
2. Topic modeling using LDA for customer segmentation.
- Comparative analysis between Superhost and Non-Superhost listings.

## Conclusions
1. Madrid offers more stable and predictable returns, while Barcelona shows higher price volatility.
2. Location, hygiene, and Superhost status are stronger satisfaction drivers than the number of amenities.
3. Guest reviews exhibit an “Airbnb bias”, with a tendency to avoid negative ratings.
4. Clear cultural and linguistic differences in guest expectations across markets.
